# Road-Accident-Prevention-Under-Diminished-Vision
The automotive industry has a wide range of design and safety measures, yet the outstanding success of airbags in preventing accidents is particularly inspiring. Around the world, there is a lot of innovation happening, and it's crucial for smart car models to focus on product recognition to prevent collisions, identify objects, and navigate safely at night. In today's world, improving visibility, such as air conditioning, is a challenging task, but machine learning offers a promising solution to prevent accidents in challenging conditions. Implementing machine learning in the automotive industry will undoubtedly lead to a reduction in accidents. While there are numerous algorithms available for detection and recognition, such as Support Vector Systems (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and others, our team has developed a smart application utilizing Faster RCNN to assist drivers in the most difficult situations. With this application, we are able to provide support to drivers when they need it most. Key words: machine learning, deep learning, object recognition, regional Convolutional neural network, Faster RCNN.
